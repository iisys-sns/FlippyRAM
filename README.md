# FlippyRAM
We developed a new framework to check if your system is vulnerable to Rowhammer, incorporating the state-of-the-art Rowhammer techniques and tools. Thus, we invite everyone to participate in this unique opportunity to join forces and close this research gap together. 
We address the following questions: 
- What is the real-world prevalence of the Rowhammer effect? 
- How many systems, in their current configurations, are vulnerable to Rowhammer?

As large-scale studies with hundreds to thousands of systems are not easy to perform, such a study has not yet been performed.

# How to Run FlippyRAM
There are two easy ways to run the tool:

1. Use the ISO image (USB Device Required)
2. Use the `Docker` container

# Steps to Run FlippyRAM Using the ISO image
HammerISO is an ISO image that can be used for automated Rowhammer testing of
different systems. In the end of the experiment, a brief overview of the number
of bit flips found by different tools is shown.

## 1. Download the ISO Image
- The FlippyRAM project provides an ISO image, HammerISO, for automated Rowhammer testing.
- Download the latest version of the ISO from [flippyr.am](https://flippyr.am).

### Alternative: Build the ISO Image (Optional)
If you'd like to build the ISO image yourself:
- Ensure you are running **ArchLinux**.
- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iisys-sns/FlippyRAM.git
cd FlippyRAM
```
- Build the ISO image using:
```bash
make
```

The resulting file, `hammeriso.iso`, will be available in the project directory.

Note: Since the ISO building process is based on **ArchISO**, this requires
**ArchLinux** in order to build the ISO image.

## 2. Flash the ISO Image
- Connect the USB drive(s) to your system.
- Flash the ISO image to all drives of a specific size using the command:
```bash
sudo sh utilities/flash.sh <device-size> <path/to/ISO/image.iso>
```
- Example:
To flash all USB devices of size 57.8G, run:
```bash
sudo sh utilities/flash.sh 57.8G hammeriso.iso
```
**BEWARE: THIS WILL OVERWRITE ALL DEVICES OF THAT SIZE!**

When it is required to flash the image to multiple thumb drives, they can be
connected to the system at the same time. Afterwards, the image will be flashed
to all to them.

The parameter `<device-size>` specifies the storage size of the thumb drive. Be
aware, this step will flash the image to **ALL CONNECTED USB DEVICE THAT HAVE
THE SPECIFIED SIZE**, so be sure to not have other USB devices with the same
size connected to the system.

The parameter `<path/to/ISO/image.iso>` specifies the path to the ISO image.

## 3. Turn Off Secure Boot
- Restart your computer and access the `BIOS/UEFI` settings. This is usually done by pressing a specific key during boot, such as `F2`, `F10`, `F12`, or `Del`
- Navigate to the Secure Boot settings. Look for options like "Boot" or "Security" in the BIOS/UEFI menu. The location of Secure Boot settings varies depending on the system manufacturer.
- Disable Secure Boot. Find the `Secure Boot` option and set it to `Disabled`. Some systems may require you to set an `Administrator Password` in the `BIOS/UEFI` before you can change this setting.
- Save changes and exit.

## 4. Run the Experiment
- Boot your target system using the USB drive with the flashed HammerISO.
- The ISO will automatically performs Rowhammer experiment and displays an overview of the results, including the number of bit flips detected.

## 5. The Results
- Logs/Results are stored and compressed in a ZIP file on a separate partition of the USB drive where you can easily access anytime.
- Multiple tests/boots will NOT erase previous results.

## 6. Upload Results (Optional)
- After completing the experiment, the setup will prompt you to upload the results to our server (Optional).
- Uploading helps contribute to the large-scale study at [flippyr.am](https://flippyr.am).

# Steps to Run FlippyRAM Using the Docker file
FlippyRAM provides a Docker file for easy and consistent deployment across different systems.
The Docker container simplifies the setup process by packaging all required dependencies and tools.
This approach allows you to run automated Rowhammer testing without worrying about system-specific configurations.

## 1. Install Docker Engine
You can find the instructions on how to install docker on your operating system here: [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## 2. Run the Experiment
- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iisys-sns/FlippyRAM.git
cd FlippyRAM/ARHE
```
- Run the `Docker` file using:
```bash
sudo bash docker-run.sh
```

## 3. The Results
- Logs/Results are stored and compressed in a ZIP file in this path: `FlippyRAM/ARHE/data`
- Multiple tests will NOT erase previous results.

## 4. Upload Results (Optional)
- After completing the experiment, the setup will prompt you to upload the results to our server (Optional).
- Uploading helps contribute to the large-scale study at [flippyr.am](https://flippyr.am).
